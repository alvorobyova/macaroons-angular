✔️ upon clicking the 'order' button, a window appears notifying which product has been added to the cart, and there is also a smooth scrolling to the form. In addition, the first field of the form is automatically filled in according to which macaron was selected<br>
✔️ after adding an item to the cart, a counter for goods and their cost is triggered (the cost can be seen by hovering over the cart icon)<br>
