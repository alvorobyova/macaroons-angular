## Macaroons order 🧁


This project was implemented using the Angular framework, the programming language used is TypeScript.
Available for use on devices of all sizes.

Styles are written using the SCSS preprocessor.

The project involves separate components designed to display identical, repeating block elements.
Various directives, services and pipes (both standard and custom) are also used.
 
✔️ upon clicking the 'order' button, a window appears notifying which product has been added to the cart, and there is also a smooth scrolling to the form. In addition, the first field of the form is automatically filled in according to which macaron was selected;
✔️ after adding an item to the cart, a counter for goods and their cost is triggered (the cost can be seen by hovering over the cart icon);
✔️ the order submission form is validated - sending an empty form is excluded;
✔️ if any field is not filled in, a warning appears (implemented using the Hot Toast plugin).
